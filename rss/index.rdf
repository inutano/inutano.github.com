        <p>I had been a kind of a man who is a bit cocky. I tended to think and behave that I could be a good reference to the others, wanted others to follow me, and also I know that I did. It might make some people frustrated, but I didn't care. I had been believing that I was right in some point, even I realized in the other point I wasn't. Something has changed. Now I'm not so as I was.</p>
        
        <p>Nobody can change the other's mind. Some can give an influence to the others, but it's slightly different from changing one's mind. It can only give a little chance to make some changes, it's not forcing to do. Behaving like an ultimate answer that everyone should follow doesn't make any senses. I just realized it last night during I was with my gf in the floor where a band was playing. The band play was awesome, I totally enjoyed but also was thinking about other thing. I noticed that I was changed a part of my mind by the other. I was never forced to be. It was like pouring water in the glass little by little, I found it just after the glass was filled and water fell to the ground. Nobody never told me that water is rising and the glass  was about to be full, because nobody intended to do so. Keep being in somewhere, or with someone, change one's state of mind gradually, and they call it "change" when they recognize.</p>
        
        <p>I don't want to tell everything, it's just a part of the story that I had. I just want to write this down here so that I can remember. It just means that I have changed.</p>]]
